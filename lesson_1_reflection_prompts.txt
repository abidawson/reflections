How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted the lines that were different between the two versions so I could quickly skim for anything that might have been changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Less time spent backtracking to find mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The automatically saved versions might be excessive or might not be saved at the right times
    But if you have to manually choose when to save you might not save frequently enough and you might lose progress when you revert to an old version
    Manually choosing when to save allows you to save at a logical point, like when a bug is fixed or a feature is added

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

     The files may be dependent on one another so it's useful to be able to revert multiple files when backtracking

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
